Avoid the red lava and find the shortest path along the black stepping stones! The algorithm can move forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally. Click refresh to generate new start and end points. The optimal path - if one exists - between the points will be calculated by the chosen algorithm.

There are two choices of algorithm: Dijkstra or A*. This visualization provide compelling evidence as to why A* is so much more efficient than Dijkstra. 

In the future I'd like to expand the project to use more pathfinding algorithms, and also allow the user to choose custom begin and end points.

This project was built using Javascript, p5.js, and Bootstrap. Special thanks to The Coding Train for getting me started.
